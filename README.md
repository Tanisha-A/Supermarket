Scope:
There is lot of confusion in a supermarket, this code stream lines the process and makes
things easier for both the seller and the buyer. The seller can access the records of each
individual customer, the goods purchased by them and the total bills. It is also convenient for the
seller to add new products as well as make changes to the existing inventory. Profits/ losses can
be viewed as well.

Explaination:
In this supermarket design MySql is used as a database. There is a main seller table that is
created in the beginning itself. At the starting the user is asked whether he is buyer or seller. If
seller he can add products to inventory, see products, see profits/losses, see each customer's
record and delete them and can remove products from the inventory too.
If the user chooses buyer, the name of the user is taken and based on the name a new table is
created if the user already exists then the changes are made to the existing table. The buyer can
see available items, search for particular item and add them to the cart, the user can also see the
cart with total amount to be paid.
