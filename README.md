# Supermarket
In this supermarket design MySql is used as a database. There is a main seller table that is
created in the beginning itself. At the starting the user is asked whether he is buyer or seller. If
seller he can add products to inventory, see products, see profits/losses, see each customer's
record and delete them and can remove products from the inventory too.
If the user chooses buyer, the name of the user is taken and based on the name a new table is
created if the user already exists then the changes are made to the existing table. The buyer can
see available items, search for particular item and add them to the cart, the user can also see the
cart with total amount to be paid.
